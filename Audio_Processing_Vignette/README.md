Vignettes using "Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star" to demonstrate audio processing and anaysis code.  
MIDI file from https://www.mfiles.co.uk/classical-midi.htm.

``vignette-Twinkle.Rmd`` shows examples of processing audio files when there are many different recordings of the same piece by different orchestras and distance calculations between these recordings are calculated.

``vignette-2pieces.Rmd`` processes **two** audio recordings only, a reference and query piece, and calculates all of the data decompositions for aligning the query piece with the reference recording.
